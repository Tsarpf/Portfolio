For now will also work as practice where I'm specifically using as much Backbone.js/Underscore.js/jQuery as I can, even when it's not necessarily the optimal choice.
F.ex, when rendering the same static page over and over again, it should probably be generated on the server so the browser can cache it. Now only the index page is from the server and the rest is loaded using ajax...
